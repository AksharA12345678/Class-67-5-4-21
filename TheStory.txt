Jack took the family cow to sell and traded it for magic beans. His mother was angry and threw them out of 
the window. The next morning a giant beanstalk had grown. He climbed the beanstalk and found a giant there 
who had gold coins. Jack stole them and took them home. Later, Jack returned and saw a hen that laid golden 
eggs and he stole that, too. The third time he tried to steal a magic harp and the harp cried out. The giant 
chased Jack down the beanstalk, Jack chopped it down and the giant died.
